    <h1> This is a page where I intend to Journey all my learnings</h1>
    <p>This is long needed, I've been learning on and off, battling with mental health issues for two years now, but I am fully in control now, I am taking steps everyday to stand up uprightly to my responsibilities, I've been cleaning my room, I've stopped doing things I know I shouldn't do and I have invested my time fully into learning about computers and the world at large</p>
    <p> follow me as I journal everything about me on this webpage.</p>
    <p>I've been grinding on tryhackme. I don't understand most of it, but it doesn't matter.</p>
    <p> all that matters is that I keep grinding, keep learning, keep using my brain everyday</p>
    <p>I've fucked up a lot in life, I think i'm wise, but i'm really just a dumb ass idiot who thinks he knows it all</p>
    <p>I've misused so much opportunities that I hate myself so much now.</p>
    <p> I've had as much opportunity in life and i've misused them all</p>
    <p> I guess we as human beings learn with pain.</p>
    <p> I've learnt so much now and I hope to keep learning</p>
    <p>Knowledge is the ONLY thing that can take me out of this hole i've dug myself into.</p>
    <p>Someday, I hope to become the Director of the NSA.</p>
    <p>end</p>
