    <h1> This is a page where I intend to Journey all my learnings</h1>
    <p>This is long needed, I've been learning on and off, battling with mental health issues for two years now, but I am fully in control now, I am taking steps everyday to stand up uprightly to my responsibilities, I've been cleaning my room, I've stopped doing things I know I shouldn't do and I have invested my time fully into learning about computers and the world at large</p>
    <p> follow me as I journal everything about me on this webpage.</p>
